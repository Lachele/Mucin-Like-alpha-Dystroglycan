This directory (PLOTS) used to be inside the ANALYSIS directory.  It was 
moved a level up so that it could be included in the git repo more easily
(the ANALYSIS directory is not included due to size). 

For this reason, most of the paths will be wrong.  To recreate any given
plot, it might be necessary to add 'ANALYSIS' to the path of the input file.

Any plots that were generated after the move will have proper paths.
