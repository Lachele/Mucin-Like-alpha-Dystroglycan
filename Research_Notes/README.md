The files in this directory are PDF printouts of notes I took as I did this 
work.  They are essentially my lab notebook.  They were originally written
as WordPress posts.  To view the originals, you need to access the WordPress
site.  The current location of these notes is: 
http://128.192.9.183/eln/lachele/category/david-live/?tag=mucin
The URL is likely to change soon.  A likely new URL will be:
https://woods.ccrc.uga.edu/lachele/category/david-live/?tag=mucin

The directory called 'From_Sparklix' contains earlier notes and is possibly 
a more accurate reflection of the very earliest phases of the work.
