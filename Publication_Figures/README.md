# Figures for the publication

This directory contains the final TIFF formatted files that are
relevant to the molecular dynamics simulations that were used in
the publication.  It also contains links to files relevant to the
generation of the figures.  

To limit file sizes, the images in the SI are not at the high 
resolution required by the journal.  The original vector formats
are available, though (follow links), so it should be easy enough
to make higher resolution versions as needed.

This document and the links in the individual directories should 
give interested persons enough information to remake any needed 
variants of the figures.  **Note**: If any .plot files are 
symbolic links, the paths to the data they use might not be 
correct.  It should be relatively easy to figure out the correct
path.  Note that some paths are left out of the git repo due to
file size issues.

The following figures are not relevant to the molecular dynamics
aspects of the publication and are not included here:  
1, 2, 3, 8, S4

All figures generated using gnuplot were exported as postscript
files.  The latter were loaded into gimp and then saved at the
requested resolution.

## Figure 4

_Comparison of peptide backbone extension_

Early versions of this figure can be found in TREATED/SUMMARIES.
The version for the paper was remade from scratch to ensure that
its origins could be tracked.

## Figure 5

_Comparison of threonine backbone atom RMSD_

I didn't remake this one from scratch because it seemed to be in 
decent shape with an obvious provenance trail.  

## Figure 6

_Sample Phi-Psi heatmaps for the glycosidic linkages_

Again, this is not remade from scratch.  Check the symbolic links to
see where the info originally came from.

## Figure 7

_Representations of the O-GalNAc and O-Man moieties_

I believe the files linked here are the videos.  The VMD files used to 
make the videos are in the directories above the one that the links 
point to.

## Figure 9

_Bifurcated and 4-way hydrogen bonding statistics_

The directory these files link into contains many more plots of these data.
For these plots, I used a spreadsheet to generate the counts for the 
histograms.  Then, I saved those counts as separate text files to be plotted.

## Figure S1

_Phi-Psi heatmaps for all GalNAc glycosidic linkages_

Follow links to see how these were made.

## Figure S2

_Phi-Psi heatmaps for all Man glycosidic linkages_

Follow links to see how these were made.

## Figure S3

_Equilibration data for the GalNAc simulations_

Follow links to see how these were made.

## Figure S5

_Heat maps for bifurcated and 4-way hydrogen bonding interactions_

I remade this one at a higher resolution because the fine 
detail in it needed more info.
