# Figures for the publication

This directory contains the final TIFF formatted files that are
relevant to the molecular dynamics simulations that were used in
the publication.  It also contains links to files relevant to the
generation of the figures.  

This document and the file links should give interested persons 
enough information to remake any needed variants of the figures.

The following figures are not relevant to the molecular dynamics
aspects of the publication and are not included here:  
1, 2, 3, 8, S4

All figures generated using gnuplot were exported as postscript
files.  The latter were loaded into gimp and then saved at the
requested resolution.

## Figure 4

_Comparison of peptide backbone extension_

Early versions of this figure can be found in TREATED/SUMMARIES.
The version for the paper was remade from scratch to ensure that
its origins could be tracked.

## Figure 5

_Comparison of threonine backbone atom RMSD_

I didn't remake this one from scratch because it seemed to be in 
decent shape with an obvious provenance trail.  

## Figure 6

_Sample Phi-Psi heatmaps for the glycosidic linkages_

Again, this is not remade from scratch.  Check the symbolic links to
see where the info originally came from.

## Figure 7

_Representations of the O-GalNAc and O-Man moieties_



## Figure 9

_Bifurcated and 4-way hydrogen bonding statistics_



## Figure S1

_Phi-Psi heatmaps for all GalNAc glycosidic linkages_



## Figure S2

_Phi-Psi heatmaps for all Man glycosidic linkages_



## Figure S3

_Equilibration data for the GalNAc simulations_



## Figure S5

_Heat maps for bifurcated and 4-way hydrogen bonding interactions_
