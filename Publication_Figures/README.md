# Figures for the publication

This directory contains the final TIFF formatted files that are
relevant to the molecular dynamics simulations that were used in
the publication.  It also contains links to files relevant to the
generation of the figures.  

This document and the file links should give interested persons 
enough information to remake any needed variants of the figures.

The following figures are not relevant to the molecular dynamics
aspects of the publication and are not included here:  
1, 2, 3, 8, S4

## Figure 4

_Comparison of peptide backbone extension_

Early versions of this figure can be found in TREATED/SUMMARIES.

## Figure 5
