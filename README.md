This repo accompanies a publication detailing an experimental and 
computational analysis of some mucin-relevant compounds.

Before making the repo, I tried to cull out files that are obviously
not relevant.  But, this is a large project spanning many years,
so here there may be cruft.

I couldn't include the simulation output here because the file
sizes are too large.  

Currently, this entire repo, in context with the simultion data,
can be accessed at the location below.  It's 70 GB in total.

Please open a ticket or contact me otherwise if you are having 
trouble understanding anything in this repo or in the full
dataset at the link above.
