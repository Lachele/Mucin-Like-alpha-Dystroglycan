ATM, these scripts assume at most 4 restarts

1.  From the DLIVE directory:

	bash refresh_run_data.bash
		# requires runset/REFRESH_SETUP
	This copies over the latest prod*.nc and prod*.info files.

2.  From each runset/FIX directory:

	bash make_cpptraj_files_to_fix_trajectories.bash  
		# requires runset/cpptraj_setup.bash
		# Also runs cpptraj
		# calls src/fix_bad_data/fix_coords
	This script removes (most, possibly all) bad data sets.  The data are bad due
		to an array failure.  Some values were printed incorrectly.  The
		program fix_coords removes any frames with inappropriate bond lengths.
	The script  also concatenates together any restart files.
	The output is a trajectory, not NetCDF.  Those can be converted if need 
		be later by following the directions in the comments.

3.  From each runset/ANALYSIS directory:

	bash make_cpptraj_files_for_analysis.bash  # must go first
		# requires runset/cpptraj_setup.bash
		# Also runs cpptraj and ptraj
	bash do_Karplus.bash
		# calls J-Couplings.pl
	bash do_2D_J-coupling.bash
		# calls src/extract_data/make_phi-psi_files
		# calls src/2D_JCOUPLING/InterpolateJ
		# requires src/2D_JCOUPLING/grid_x_y_J_12_14
	bash do_SDM.bash  
		# requires runset/REFRESH_SETUP  
	bash get_timings_sizes.bash  # do this last
		# requires runset/REFRESH_SETUP
	

4.  These might also be of interest:

	From the input directory:
		bash view_molecules.sh
	From the DLIVE directory
		bash view_trajectories.bash
		bash gather_timings.bash

5.  These contain information about making plots
	examples
	multi.plot multiS.plot
	P4 P5 P6 P7
	PhiPsi_Hist4.plot PhiPsi_Map4.plot
	S4 S5 S6 S7

6.  This contains the source for any compiled programs
	src
