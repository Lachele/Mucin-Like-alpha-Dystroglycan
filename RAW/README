These are runs for David Live.  They begin with experimental structures.

directory d4m contains pdbs from /e05/lachele/Win7Mount/DLIVE_PHI-PSI_Angles/d4m_new

	There are 36 total structures.  I will use 32 of them.

directory d4g contains pdbs from /e05/lachele/Win7Mount/DLIVE_PHI-PSI_Angles/d4g

	There are 16 structures.  I will do each twice.



These jobs were moved to CPU's on Rime for the last few steps:

	d4g  3 10 19 25 26
	
	d4m  4

These jobs were moved to CPU's on Swift for the last few steps:

	d4g  16 32

The following had accidentally been restarted for too many steps, and was left unfinished:

	d4g 13
